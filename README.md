# Path-finder-using-Iterative-KNN

A trip-planning system that finds out a list of points that forms the shortest trajectory between two points, from a list of query points.

The implementation adopts the IKNN (Incremental k-nearest neighbor) algorithm described in the paper: "Searching Trajectories by Locations: An Efficiency Study, Zaiben Chen, et al., SIGMOD 2010"

Language used: Java
